## üèó Install

Clone the repo using Git. You'll need Docker, Node.js (tested with v12) and Yarn (tested with v1.21.1).

```sh
yarn install
```

## üöÄ Usage

The project runs an InfluxDB database and a Grafana instance, launch them with docker compose:
```sh
docker compose up -d
```

In the meantime, export your Apple Watch data from your iPhone. In the Health App:

![Click on your picture](./images/export-step-1.jpeg)
![Export All Health Data](./images/export-step-2.jpeg)
![Export](./images/export-step-3.jpeg)

Send the zip file to your computer.

Then run:
```sh
npm start <path_to_export.zip>
```
Grab a coffee while your data is read and inserted in InfluxDB (my data takes more than a minute to be loaded)!

üìà Once the script ends, your Grafana dashboard should be available at http://localhost:3000/d/apple-watch-workouts/year-dashboard?orgId=1.

**This dashboard is just a proof of concept**, take full advantage of Grafana, try to edit the panels and even add yours if you want to!

> *Please make sure to show me your dashboard on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hey%20@_YannBertrand%20%F0%9F%91%8B%0A%0A%F0%9F%93%88%20Take%20a%20look%20at%20my%202019%20workouts%20dashboard) üòÅ*

## ‚ùì Questions

### How do I use this with another tracker?

The project has been specially designed for the Apple Watch Health data but it shouldn't be too complicated to do it for another tracker. Just ask me if you want to do it!

### How do I replace a chart?

Please go to [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/features/panels/singlestat/) and have fun exploring üòä.

### Why is my preferred activity not displayed?

Because I didn't take time to find them automatically (cycling, walking, swimming, strength training, running and volleyball are hardcoded). Contributions are welcome!

### How do I update my data?

You'll have to export the zip file and run `npm start export.zip` again.

### I got an error while running `npm start export.zip`, what should I do?

If you have this kind of error:

```bash
    throw new Error(`${workoutActivityType} workoutActivityType not handled yet`);
    ^

Error: HKWorkoutActivityTypeNonExistingActivityType workoutActivityType not handled yet
```

You'll have to add the workout type to the list in `./lib/mapper.js`, please open a PR if you have to do it.

For any other error, please [open an issue](https://github.com/yannbertrand/apple-watch-workouts-year-review/issues/new) (or make [a PR](https://github.com/yannbertrand/apple-watch-workouts-year-review/pulls) if you know how to fix it!).

## üöß Run unit tests

```sh
npm test
```
